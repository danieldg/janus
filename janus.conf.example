# Janus configuration file
#
# This is a line-based configuation file, divided into blocks for networks
# and other grouped settings.

# Set block: settings for the janus server itself
set {
	# Server name - set this to a single unique word. This is used to identify
	# the server in the interjanus protocol.
	# This does NOT need to be a domain name; it should be short.
	name yourserver
	# Saved data location - this is the file which janus will load and save
	# state (such as the list of shared channels) between runs
	save janus.dat
	# Janus nick - change this if you want a different interface nick
	# ident and host are similarly settable
	janus_nick janus
	# Administrator password - if set, this enables an "admin" account with 
	# full access to all commands. Once you have created normal accounts,
	# this should be disabled as the password is stored in plaintext.
	password verysecret
	# Link mode - use janus as a network partition or a transparent bridge
	#  link - network partition, channels must be explicitly linked
	#  bridge - transpaent link, all channels linked, opers are more global
	lmode link
	# Run mode - process execution style
	#  mplex - Handle SSL and sockets using C; allows for perl process to be
	#	transparently restarted if perl's memory allocation gets too large
	#  uproc - Handle sockets internally to the worker process
	# If "-daemon" is appended, janus will daemonize and optionally record its PID
#	pidfile janus.pid
#	runmode uproc-daemon

	# Other parameters as defined by modules may be present here
	# Example: Commands::Debug takes a date-based format for the dump files
	datefmt %Y%m%d-%H%M%S

	# SSL certificate. Only required if you are using an SSL server port,
	# but will be presented as client certificates on connections
	# These can be overridden in an individual link block
	ssl_certfile server.cert.pem
	ssl_keyfile server.key.pem

# Modules block: this is a list of modules which are loaded at startup.
# Modules can also be loaded or unloaded while janus is running.
# See README for a short description of each module.

	## The following settings are specific to the File type:
	# Run a dump before opening the log file (for possible replays)
	#dump 1
	# rotate the log every N seconds

# Listen blocks: listen for incoming server connections
#
# No listen block is required if you have janus connect to your servers
#
# The type of server is determined by the IP of the incoming connection;
# one port can be used for SSL and non-SSL, and for all types of servers.
# You cannot accept incoming connections from a server if another server
# shares its IP address; use outgoing connections or alternative IPs.
